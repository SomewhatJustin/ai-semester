This is a repo for my college-without-college semester.

My goal is to learn with the structure of a college semester, but with the best practices that we know outperform the traditional classroom model. I will also save a lot of money this way!

This course is for AI Engineering. I will by using Chip Huyen's [AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models](https://www.amazon.com/AI-Engineering-Building-Applications-Foundation/dp/1098166302?linkId=01816c7d3ddfbc9515349562c9b55eae&language=en_US) as my textbook. See [syllabus](./docs/syllabus.md) for a more detailed overview of how I am running this course.

I will post some of my raw thoughts in the [learning log](./docs/learning-log.md), but you can expect more refined findings on [my blog](https://justin.how/blog).
